# Applied-AI-Study-Group

This is the repository for the content of inzva 2019-July Applied AI Study Group, guided by Ahmet Melek.

In the group we have worked on these subjects:

* Frameworks: Tensorflow, Keras, SystemML, DL4J, Apache Spark

* Problems: Image Classification, Image Generation (Image Restoration/Inpainting), Anomaly Detection, Timeseries Future Prediction, NLP Embedding, NLP Sentence Sentiment Classification

* Architectures - Methods: Multilayer Perceptron (Fully-Connected Neural Networks), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Autoencoders, Embedding Layers

## Weekly Summaries

### Week1

We have worked on three problems:

* Image Classification with MNIST dataset on tensorflow, using Fully-Connected Neural Networks.

* Image Classification with MNIST dataset on keras, using Convolutional Neural Networks.

* Image Generation with Aligned UTK dataset on keras, using Deep Convolutional Generative Adverserial Networks (DCGAN Autoencoder). 

### Week2

We have worked on three problems:

* Anomaly Detection with Bearing Data Center Seeded Fault Test dataset on keras, using LSTM autoencoders.

* Timeseries future prediction with Federal Reserve Economic Data Crude Oil Prices Chart on keras, using LSTM Networks.

* NLP Embedding and Classification with a custom mini-dataset on keras, using perceptrons, multilayer perceptrons and Embedding layers.
